# Movie Extract Transform Load

In this project, we took on the task of creating a data pipeline for movie information from multiple sources (Wikipedia and Kaggle), cleaning up the missing or irrelevant data and merged the two datasets into two different SQL databases. One includes the general information regarding the different movies (ie. budget, people who worked on the film, etc.) while the other table included ratings pulled from around different sources that had been collected by Kaggle.
